                It is not uncommon to find many companies, or a group of companies, that while being under the
                same top management, are working in different business lines with regard to either products/services,
                markets or technology.

                    For such companies, a single strategy is not only inadequate but also inappropriate. The need is for
                    multiple strategies at different levels. In order to segregate different units or segments, each performing
                    a common set of activities, many companies organize on the basis of operating divisions or, simply,
                    divisions. These divisions may also be known as profit centres or strategic business units (SBUs). An SBU,
                    as defined by Sharplin, is “any part of a business organization which is treated separately for strategic
                    management purpose.”
